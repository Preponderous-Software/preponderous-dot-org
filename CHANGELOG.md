# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

The site has been redesigned from Spring Boot + Thymeleaf to Next.js + React + MUI, mirroring [dansplugins-dot-com](https://github.com/Dans-Plugins/dansplugins-dot-com) (epic #31, static first pass).

### Added

- Next.js + React + Material UI + Emotion project scaffold, alongside the existing app (#32).
- Shared layout chrome: `TopBar` and `BottomBar`, with an accessible "skip to main content" link (#33).
- Persisted light/dark color-mode toggle that follows the OS preference until the visitor chooses (#34).
- Home page with a data-driven project showcase: `ProjectCard`, intro `Blurb`, and a grid seeded from `pages/data/projects.json` (#35).
- `Seo` component emitting title, description, and Open Graph / Twitter card metadata (#36).
- Friendly themed `404` and `500` error pages within the standard chrome (#37).
- GitHub Actions CI: test + build on pull requests, with a Docker image build on `main` (#27).
- Documentation set: `README`, `CONFIG.md`, `USER_GUIDE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and this changelog (#39).
- Component-render test coverage for `ProjectCard` and `Blurb` using React Testing Library + jsdom (#38).
- Node-based `Dockerfile`, `compose.yaml`, and dev container; CI switched to npm (#40).

### Removed

- The legacy Spring Boot + Thymeleaf application (`src/`, Gradle build, and wrapper) — the site is now served entirely by the Next.js app (#40).
